Discount factor and Present Vallue (PV)
Alice and Bob set up a contract that starts now and ends at T=1:
* Right now (at time t=0) Alice pays to Bob a fixed amount of money
* In return , at time t=T=1 Bob will pay to Alice 1 unit of money
To make this a fair contract ...
... how much should Alice pay to Bob right now?
Let us denote by P(1) this amount. This number is called the discount factor for tenor 1.
Note that P(0)=1.
